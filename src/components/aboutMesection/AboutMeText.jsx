      <p className="text-cream py-14">
        I’m Harshita Kushwaha—the kind of developer who finds beauty in bugs and
        clarity in chaos. Whether it's debugging deep dives or spontaneous
        feature ideas over coffee, I live for the thrill of solving problems and
        creating sleek, functional experiences from scratch. Fluent in Java,
        grounded in DSA, and styled with Tailwind, I build systems that are
        fast, responsive, and unapologetically bold. I don’t just write code—I
        engineer digital journeys that balance logic with aesthetic finesse.
        Currently immersed in React and sharpening my DSA skills, I’m growing
        fast and building faster. I believe clean architecture is as important
        as clean code, and every component should serve both purpose and
        personality. To me, every project is a story, and every line of code is
        a sentence worth writing right. I code with curiosity, refactor with
        care, and deploy with pride. I’m not here to just build websites—I’m
        here to craft digital experiences that feel as good as they function. If
        you're looking for a developer who thinks in algorithms, designs with
        heart, and delivers with fire—you just found her.
